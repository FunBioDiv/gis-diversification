So we have to re-calculate the size of the entire field of the year when the study was carried out.\nFor the area, it is simplified thanks to the variable seq_surf giving the area of the sub-fields in ha, and parcelYYYY with the ID of the parcel for each year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Correlations among field areas in the time series. The subarea is the area from sub-fields provided directly in the RPG sequence de culture. The areas are calculated from all the fields with the same ID in a given year.\n\n\n\n\n\nTO BE DISCUSSED:\n- the correlation in field areas in the successive years are (relatively) low compared to my expectations (field size shouldn’t change so much in 10-year period, and more closely related years should be more correlated). Are the results shown in Figure 5 normal or does it indicate possible errors in merging subfields?\n\n\nPerimeter\nThis is a tricky operation, because sub-fields do not overlap properly (different edges), and sometimes they have complex geometry. So far, the best solution that I found is to:\n\naggregate (or dissolve) with aggregate()\n\nmerge non touching polygons by calculating convex hull hull(type = \"concave_length\")\n\nand simplify the geometry to remove some unecessary complicated geometries with simplifyGeom()\n\nThe perimeter is highly sensible to all theses steps (the area much less).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Exploration of how to merge sub-fields\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of sites with fields found in RPG sequence de culture\n\n\n\nFALSE  TRUE \n    4   223 \n\n\nSummary of the area of fields (in \\(ha\\))\n\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.
